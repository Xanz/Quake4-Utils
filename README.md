# Quake4-Utils
Some useful scripts to help test Quake 4 multiplayer mods. They will need some modification to work with your system as I tried to keep the paths static so they can work on any windows machine.

I typically place these next to the Quake4.exe, so that they are easy to access and you only need to open the Quake 4 main folder to run them.
